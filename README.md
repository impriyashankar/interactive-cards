  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

This project helped me explore form validation techniques in detail. From handling various error scenarios to implementing custom error messages, I encountered challenges and fixing the issues throughout were huge learnings.<br>Designing layouts that change based on user's device was exciting as I could make extensive use of flexbox properties.
